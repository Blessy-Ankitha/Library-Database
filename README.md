The library database provides access to refer the books as per 
the user's wish. 
The library database focuses on the following: 
 User record,  
 book record,  
 author record and  
 publisher record. 
Java Swing is used to design the front-end application. 
The user must initially login to his account; if the user does not 
have an account, he will have to sign up. 
After logging in, the user will be given an option to choose the book type to which 
he is willing to refer. 
The user will then be provided a link to access the book online
